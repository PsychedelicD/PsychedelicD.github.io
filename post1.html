      <p>So this is it. The first one. I think in the future I am going to write these out on a notepad first so it isnt so tedious to write them. Currrently writing this from the terminal. Kinda dumb on my part. Wanna sleep but also dont wanna, coding is fun. I love making my website, I think i finnally found a new hobby I will truly enjoy. Anyways. I should probably sign off here. I think it would be funny if I kept each entries code the same. It could work like a time capsule to see what I knew how to do with code. This site looks like something from the 90s, and I kind of like that look. Maybe i'll lean into it and make it look good. Idk. tired. gn yall.</p>
